			<p class="interesting">The cheetah is the world's fastest land mammal. With acceleration that would leave most automobiles in the dust, a cheetah can go from 0 to 60 miles an hour in only three seconds. These big cats are quite nimble at high speed and can make quick and sudden turns in pursuit of prey.</p>

			<p>The cheetah lives in three main social groups: females and their cubs, male "coalitions", and solitary males. Females lead a nomadic life searching for prey in large home ranges. Males are more sedentary and may instead establish much smaller territories in areas with plenty of prey and access to females.</p>
